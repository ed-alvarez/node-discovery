# Discovery

Discovery is a small tool used to discover ports inside a network on all
available interfaces and IP ranges without specifying IPs or any kind of information
about the network it's running on.

This utility looks for the required services and generates certain
client configuration
based on the network information gathered.

# The repository

As of right now, further development is completely halted. The purpose of this 
repository is to showcase a PoC in NodeJS. Plans to turn it into a public node 
module are possible.
