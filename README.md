# Discovery

Discovery is a small tool used to discover ports inside a network on all
available interfaces and IP ranges without specifying IPs or any kind of information
about the network it's running on.

# The repository

As of right now, further development is completely halted. The purpose of this 
repository is to showcase a PoC in NodeJS. Plans to turn it into a public node 
module are possible.
